# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
#
# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      A scan chain loads in and out the design to execute the processor. 
      Enable signals for scan chain and processor operation.

      Scan chain output on output 7.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      TODO: Please see the project specification.
